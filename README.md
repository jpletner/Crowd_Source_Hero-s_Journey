Learn Academy Exercise: MadLib Challenge:
This was the actual challenge:
   -Make a Mad Libs of your own.
   -Make a form letter where the user inputs their name, and they get back a letter addressed to them.
   -Create a page that asks the user to type something into a field, and when they submit the form, have the page say it back to them in all uppercase.


    *Challenge was to create a madlib type application utilizing forms and jquery.
    *My partner and I decided to create a story instead of a standard madlib. 
    *The application creates a story based on a users selections from a built in form.

Languages Used: HTML, CSS, jQuery
